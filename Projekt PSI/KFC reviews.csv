Homeless begging should not worry you but what you eat should some days 6 out of 7 the under breaded DIY meat market bought chicken with a hair hair there and a bloody vein there hair and vein don't pop a vein messing with that shame oversized pieces clearly has antibiotic and steroids packed to the brim a chicken thigh is half chicken size and bloody in the middle be sure to see who runs these stores as nationwide they follow same batshit practices.Get safe.
It's in an interesting part of town so there may be rowdy customers in there but the workers are quick and an amazing chicken pot pie only costs about $7. Highly recommend it for that item alone.
I ordered a 3 pc meal 2 breast 1wing with fries. I received a 2 pc thigh and drum with cold mashed potatoes. I also paid 30 cents for a honey mustard sauce that I didn’t receive. This was my second and last time trying this place out.
I was craving KFC I got two breasts. KFC is only good when its hot and fresh.. I hadn't had it in a while. It was a bit too salty but my cravings was satisfied. The cost of two breast was good.
Does the job. As there are so few KFCs in Manhattan I make a point of frequenting this one when in Union Sq. Great staff. I dislike the homeless people using the drinks machine because I find it unhygienic (always placing dirty cups on the tabs or grimy fingers). It could do with a security guard. They lose a star as I always have to get bottled water because of the above issue. But one of the few that still do the $5.44 2 pieces mash/ fries and a biscuit deal.
Lazy cashiers who won't even look at your order number if it's on the app. Soda fountain isn't maintained my Starry had zero carbonation. Crown Fried Chicken has better service somehow.
People who work at this place are extremely rude I placed an order through Uber Eats after 20 minutes the store called me saying that they didn't have my order and that I would have to cancel it since Uber charges a fee for cancellation I explained that I wouldn't cancel it because Uber wouldn't give me my money back and that this would be their problem and they would have to cancel it! Even so they didn't want to cancel it I tried to change my order and they didn't want to I believe that because I had placed an order on sale they didn't want to place my order and made excuses for not doing so!
Clean place fresh food  nice music
A staff member cashier wearing a navy blue uniform threw a chair and started laughing at a patron after altercation with unruly customer could have handled situation better.
Food is very good but employees are very rude we order around 65 dollars and they denied the restroom by saying the bathroom was out of service which is not true cause my mother could used when they forgot to locked is mandatory a kind of place like this have a restroom in this time when is fair to have a place to at least wash your hands before you gonna eat. Thanks and I hope the company take care of his customers by checking this situation in this location. Thanks. Also all trash cans are full of garbage no one clean them. This place needs a manager urgently
Food quality is bad this place is crowded with delivery guys you have a homeless man opening the door for you etc. Its just a whole mess over here
The lady manager was super friendly wouldn’t mind coming here to order when she here easy to order follow the promotion on the window poster
The extra crispy chicken tasted hard as mummy. I developed a severe stomach ache and threw up all my food after eating it there is definitely something wrong with the hygiene of this place. the cookies tasted good softer than Popeyes. But I wouldn't go back to this place ever.
Excellent establishment — manager instated rule that no one can eat in the lobby after 2am for no quantifiable reason. Kind gentlemen and gentlewomen working the night shift allow a good lad like myself to eat there regardless knowing I will be respectful of the restaurant and leave it as I came. Serving up quality white meat chicken all hours of the day the food is as good at 2 am as it is anytime - there is 0 drop off in quality. I wish I lived near a KFC… I live next to a Popeyes and this blows it out of the water. All love KFC
Don’t order anything from here. It is now the missing item and the food looks like leftover
Today I took out an 8pc chicken set and a fried chicken wing. The food was cooked quickly and tasted good but the fried chicken wing was not cooked.
THE WORST FOOD EVER. The only thing that was delicious was the mash potatoes. Bearly any chicken it was extremely greasy. I asked for a zinger $5 deal they didnt even make it made me wait
I have been eating KFC chicken for years and this place is why. Never had an issue with the quality of the food always good.
Never been inside but I like passing by this KFC and smelling the fried chicken
“Saucy Nuggets” I am so happy I bought more sauce on my own. Disappointing
we were there on 22/10/2023 the service is very poor the toilet doesn’t work the staff doesn’t wash their hands unsanitary conditions
There is definitely better food options out there but if you are looking for a cheap fast meal... this place checks both those boxes. Cluck cluck!!!
Complaint About Food Quality and Resulting Illness from order I am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue regarding the quality of food I received from your establishment. On [5/19/2024] I ordered a 12-piece box meal from the KFC order number [135743412] Unfortunately the last three pieces of chicken in the box were visibly corrupt and emitted a foul odor. These pieces were discolored appearing black and unfit for consumption. Despite the off-putting appearance and smell my mother unknowingly consumed them which has led to severe consequences. Shortly after eating the contaminated pieces my mother began experiencing significant stomach pain. Her condition has worsened to the extent that we now have to take her to the hospital due to suspected food poisoning caused by the chicken. This incident is deeply concerning as it raises serious questions about the food safety and quality control standards at your restaurant. I urge you to investigate this matter thoroughly to prevent similar occurrences in the future. In light of the distress and medical expenses incurred I am requesting a formal response from your team detailing the steps that will be taken to address this complaint and ensure such an incident does not happen again. I would also appreciate compensation for the 12-piece meal and any related medical costs. attention to this serious issue.
I was here about half hour ago. I take off my earbuds as I start to approach the counter the girl that was on her cell leaves some tall guy start to come to the counter looks at me and goes back. I leave. Too bad I can't rate this experience zero stars.
Service is extremely slow. An employee who was a cook in the back was complaining about doing her job and making the new chick pizzas. I understand it’s a new item but she clearly showed lack of frustration and patience and didn’t try to hide it either. She even loudly stated after I got my order “I’m not making anymore.”
"First your staff needs training. They don't know what customer service is. I ordered food just now the girl just throw it on the counter like I am a 🐕. Staff talking to manager any how they feel. This kfc location has the most ""DISRESPECTFUL STAFF"" Why can't the manager talk to the staff??? You all need to get your act together. If you think your'e better than working at KFC you should all quit. 100's of people are looking for jobs"
Extremely rude staff and very dirty. They don’t treat the dumpsters here nicely or with respect. You ask a question and they respond to someone else in another language and don’t respond back to you. Manuni and manager were rude.
Try to order and ask what is in it as I like to know what I am eating if I don’t know something but the person handling me just said look to sign instead of describing it (some people would like for others to describe what is in it). Also when trying to order the lady won’t stop talking or ask customer to step aside for a few min so I can place order. When trying to order she could not get my order correct despite me reiterating/repeating what I needed or try to check with me to ensure I had the right order. Left without ordering as it did not seem she could get my order right and her tone came across as rude. Would not recommend. Customer service could be better improved.
Calm staff nice tidy place good smelling food
I am only leaving this for the staff that was working Halloween they were so kind and nice even in all the chaos. We ordered so many chicken tenders and they were so nice and kind and even with all the drunk people in they where dealing with them as best they could. The manager specially I can remember his name but he was the best.
