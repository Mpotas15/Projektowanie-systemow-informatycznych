Completely rude I ask about three time can I order at the cash register a lady told me he’s coming three times and never came. I waited almost an hour before somebody ask is the register open then he finally came. And I still never got to place my order they should not be working the with rude Customer connection and no Proper communication whatsoever
I want to take a moment to highlight the dedication of the McDonald's staff who always seem to be juggling an overwhelming number of tasks with grace. It's clear they work tirelessly to keep up with the constant stream of customers and their varying demands. Despite the pressure the employees at this location consistently go above and beyond. What really stands out to me is how they always find the energy to be kind and accommodating even during the busiest times. They are not just polite but genuinely warm and friendly—especially toward my child which makes every visit a positive experience for our family. I truly appreciate their hard work and positivity in such a fast-paced environment. It's not easy but their efforts don't go unnoticed. Kudos to the team for their commitment to great service!
Completely overwhelmed McDonalds location. Everyone waited 30 minutes for their food getting angry at the staff and it’s not their fault. Not a great atmosphere. When the food was ready it was done incorrectly (see picture of the oatmeal). Probably the worst mcdonalds i’ve ever been to.
Not sure why I would ever expect better than the McDonald’s on Delancey but I waited 15 minutes this morning for an egg and cheese biscuit after they clearly forgot to even work on my order. What’s the point of the screen if your number doesn’t end up on the “prepared” or “ready” screen? No acknowledgement of the ridiculously wait time for my simple order that I’m sure that had been sitting there getting like warm while I waited. Haven’t tried McDonald’s in years and now I know why!
This is a pretty late review but when they had Pokemon cards as happy meal toys they gave me a Mario kart toy instead. It's clear the employees were stealing the cards probably to resell. When I discovered it I had to go all the way back to ask for the cards and they nonchalantly gave me the toy I should've gotten. No doubt they've stolen a lot of Pokemon cards from unsuspecting people.
Every time I come to this location something else is wrong this time it wasn’t that big of a deal the issue I had with my food. It was more so the way they handled it I was given half a slice of cheese on my sandwich and I really just wanted a full slice of cheese. I brought it up to the counter before I could even tell the person with my issue was I saw one of the workers look at me that whispered to the other coworker in Spanish. That already set my attitude off from that point on I was not a happy customer at all. Then to top it off after they remade my sandwich they gave it to me with a full slice of cheese but with none of the other stuff I already had on there. Service is always slow and the works think that whispering in Spanish conceals their conversations when in actuality it further rules the negative experience because not only are you talking crap about me in my face you also insult my intelligence by assuming I can’t understand when I understand every single word
Not much for expectations when you enter any NYC McDonalds. This one is aesthetically pleasing having recently been updated. Clutch location for fast food anytime.
Pretty decent McDonalds to get decently priced food in the heart of Lower East Side. The interior is super spacious there are kiosks built into the walls and the bathroom was super clean. Unfortunately they closed the second floor for reasons unknown. It was also super busy when I went (Friday Night) so the orders took an extremely long amount of time to prepare (over 15-20 minutes).
Just stopped by to warm up an hour before my bus showed up around the corner. I gave money for someone else to eat there. Seems nice.
Conveniently located Mcdonalds right next to the Delancey St– Essex St Subway Station Seating fills up quick during the daytime as it is Manhattan Ordered a large McCafe coffee and it was made to expected standard
Of all the times I've been here 1/3 of my orders were made incorrectly. I get they are in a rush but the amount of times my fish fillet came with lettuce and no cheese. Need basic quality control
Sometimes you think you had enough of McDonald’s and then the kids see that big M and you go in again... the thing is ordering using the order machines is fun and useful the food is better than ever🤷🏻‍♂️ so every time I am surprised all over again absolutely worth it kids go crazy we enjoy every bite and compared to alternatives it is very cheap just make sure you don’t go in every day 
I went to get some food last night and ask them to let me use the bathroom and they didn’t let me use the bathroom they were all close. The guy in a mocking tone told me there were a bar in the corner to go there. I told him I’m not eating at that bar I got my food here. I understand that people use the bathroom for bad things at night but if I’m a customer that already got my food there and they saw me I’m not drunk or crazy they should let you use the bathroom I’ll scale this to social media
You can order using the hi-tech interactive screens or see a cashier. There is one restroom downstairs and two upstairs. The upstairs has a nice seating area including a large group table and several booths. Food was alright. They wouldn't let us buy cups of ice.. Which was quite odd. Also one of the sauces that came with our chicken nuggets had a hole in the side so we threw it out. On a side note: we found a portable Nintendo slide in one of the restrooms and turned it in downstairs at the cashier/kitchen area (6/3/2018).
The food is good ole macdonalds quality food. Never had a problem with my food or drink. In the lunch time and evening it's get busy duh but I think they handle it well and personally they have messed up any one my orders. My only problem is that finding a seat can be hard. They have a whole upstairs seating area that closed off and has been closed for a few months now there's only 5-6 booths and 2-3 tables with a chair and a long one sides booth on the other side of the table. Is those are full there some seats near the front with a table mounted to the wall and single seatsbut if all those are full (there almost always full) you'll just have to look out for people that looking like their cleaning upstand on the sides or eat somewhere else.
Hey everybody its officially opened back up and newly renovated a few weeks back. Before the renovation as some frequenters would recall the place quickly turned into a fast food toilet hole especially late at nights. Back then you'd come in join the cue and immediately felt disgusted with yourself and while standing there in the long line you couldn't help but begin second guessing your decision to dine in and pretty much all the other choices you made in life oh the good old days. For a good hit of nostalgia may I recommend looking up this McDs on YouTube and reminiscence about the various disgruntled customers midnight ruckus and actual brawls making their way inside as well as other characters that have added... to the vibrancy of the community. Good times. Well folks worry no more now it's brand new and sanitized with a second floor for additional seatings and what's the best part? There are plenty of electric outlets! That's right now you too can enjoy your meal snack cup of coffee whatever and charge your devices at the same time. If that doesn't put value in your value meal I don't know what will and get a load of this: they've added several automated kiosk style machines in the first floor! That's right folks the future is here with every value meal. The days of self doubt and self loathing are behind us thanks to the golden arch. No more smell of stank breath stale urine upon entering the establishment nor the sight of mysterious brown stains covered up with a quick swipe of wet mop and bleach instead you can finally welcome yourself to the fresh smell of coffee or microwaved patties. The smell of modernity is truly in the air. In addition to adding awe inspiring technological innovations with your every order they have also made other changes as well including eliminating that annoying token access system for the restrooms. Learning from the past they have also hired one private security person downstairs now so we'll have to see how that works out to deter the riff raffs in the long run. Fingers crossed y'all. Seriously the penny-pinching Ancapistanian in me is all giddy with glee. In fact there is a smile on my face as I enjoy a dollar sammich and diet Coke while writing this review upstairs listening to Fleetwood Mac playing in the background. If it weren't for the high rent hyper cost of living colossal student debt bubble and impending stock market crash I'd say it's heaven on Earth am I right? Well okay maybe that's going a bit too far but we're getting there right? Fingers crossed on the other hand y'all. May the Lords preserve the dollar menu.
Clean and fast food. Two fish sandwiches that I had first time in 10+ years were $6 plus tax. Hit the spot and I left. One of the employees had to put the code to allow me to use their bathroom. Overall 5 stars! Keep up the good work.
A well run store with no one dining in so it is pretty quiet (the upstairs is closed). Security is there keeping the peace.
Its 2.15 a.m. I literally just walked out of there. One register was open and no one at the counter. I stood at the register. 2 employees looked at me. Served the customers that ordered ahead and just went back to the kitchen. Guy in gray shirt was telling the other guy that I was waiting and he said he's not going out there. It's literally empty. And I told him tell him not to worry. I don't want anything now. Poor service. I was on my lunch break from mta. 15 mins wasted of my 30 min break.
The staff was friendly. The service was very slow. The food was acceptable. The coffee was burnt and not the way the way I ordered it. Even with the slow service they did forget to check my order was correct before giving it to me. Which was missing an item until I told them. They were apologetic and gave me what was missing and I went on my way. I don't think I would come back unless I had no other choice of McDonald's. 03/2024
I was getting breakfast right I ordered Maybe 6 items well MY FOOD TOOK 30 MINUTES TO MAKE I WAS SURPRISED I DID NOT LEAVE. And honestly this might be the slowest McDonald’s I’ve ever been too never go here lunch time took me 20 minutes for me also there was NO ONE AT THE CASH Register so those people waited forever for some to be at the cash register. Never go here….
"5 Stars for great location food is good (fast food good obviously) but I am not writing this to talk about the good things with this location as there is something dangerously wrong with this location Which is social distancing... No social distancing as you can see for yourself in the photo attached. If you're looking to crave for McDonald's late at night because you've decided your too lazy to cook and you don't wanna pay delivery fee taxes and tip just be ready to go in there with a full hazmat suit gloves alcohol spray or lysol. The location does offer pickup through the McDonald's app but do not waste your time due to Mcdonald's not starting your order until you actually arrive and it just defeats the whole purpose of even ordering through the app. I wish management here could just take some tips from chick-fil-a as whenever I pickup from Chick-fil-a they seem to have it under control as much as me not having nothing to complain about. As of a result of this location's poor effort to make things safer for there customers I will no longer be picking up food from here anymore and will revert to delivery or just trying to actually cook lol. When there's improvement I'll be more than happy to edit or add onto my existing review. Mind you.. as in ""improvement"" how hard is it actually to assign an employee to handing deliveries to uber/grubhub/doordash drivers through the side door. Or how hard is it to promote ordering through the McDonald's app and have people wait outside for their orders? Just an idea as it is already being done in other franchises."
Josselyin ( cashier) is rude like she didn’t want to work the morning shift knowing the morning shift is busy she need to check her attitude the manager is pretty kool No mix in the McFlurry the upstairs is always close smh what the point have 2nd floor
They just renewed that store but some of cashier very slow like a ghost. Also they give people fast food but not tasty. I bought chicken tender it was dry and inside raw.
Hit or miss depending on day and time. Sometimes it’s less than 15 min and taste great. Sometimes it’s 1 hour lost your order blame you for not listening and the quarter pound will just have ketchup and a patty🤷🏻‍♀️(better to just avoid Sundays). I actually think it’s better to order for pickup through doordash. You have another layer of receipt (and refund policy) and they seem to prioritize delivery. The kiosk doesn’t always print the receipt and the order screen seems to be broken with for upcoming order number.
They gave me Luke warm ice coffee with no ice (out of ice) and cold breakfast burrito then told me to step to the side when I was the only one waiting in line. Just give me crabs and round out the experience.
They need to check the security guards a man was literally harassing us and we came in and Took a bite of our ice cream that we paid for and he told us we need to get out of the store immediately. Literally had customers coming up and asking us if we are OK and we need protection. It was the short light skin one. The other 2 were so calm with us. He is taking his security job at McDonald’s too serious
this is quite literally the worst mcdonald’s in america the employees do not know what it means to be a fast food restaurant. you’ll be waiting long af just to get an order that is likely not even correct. mobile order? somehow takes longer than ordering at the counter.
Omg I had issues at the kiosk but ANGEL helped me at the counter and was so nice. He's a good person and employee
Never going back there because waiting a long time to get the food n did not even Melt the cheese at all
